# buzzwords_cv
A Plaintext CV project FULL of buzzwords

## Usage:
Make a new version of CV:
```bash
make cv file_name=my_cv_name
```

# TODO
- Should be able to have sections, and in between lines between sections, have a line of buzzwords
- Maybe should fill empty space in lines before and after visible text with buzzwords

# DONE
- Can export plain text python to PDF
- Can choose which text is visible and which is invisible (with {WHITE} and {NC} tags)
- Can import figures like Cowsay and Flowers
